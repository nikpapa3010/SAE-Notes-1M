Converting text to integer:
	if we use int.Parse(x) or int.tryParse(x) we can convert text to int.
	same with floats: float.Parse(x) or float.tryParse(x)
	
TryParse gives a bool, because if the convertion doesn't work, it sends a bool, if it did, it sends a true


out keyword inside a method can be used, in example, when we have a boolean method, which will return a bool, but we also want to return some kind of other variable. Very useful! 
example:

public bool CheckAndNumber(int num1, int num2, out int results)
