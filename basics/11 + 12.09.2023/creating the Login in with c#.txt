saving the password doesn't work...

class already defines the code, which makes the app no longer remember the code... 
perhaps i need to call the login method again?

perhaps i need a way to make the method remember the new code, will look into it


FIX.
i made it work, by deleting the code variable from the class, and giving it as a parameter in the login method. 
i serialized the parameter and then when i call the login method in the new password method i put as a parameter the new method.
kinda junky, but it works :)
